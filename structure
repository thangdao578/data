✅ TIKTOK-FRIENDLY AD COPY STRUCTURE (OPTIMIZED)
(Part 1) Shocking Hook Opening – Hit a "Pain Point" Fast
Goal: Grab attention in 3 seconds by stating a relatable struggle or surprise.
Avoid: Overly negative or extreme language.

✅ Sample Hooks (Compliant & Effective):

"Thought I was just lazy… turns out it was something else."

"Why does no one talk about this annoying problem?"

"If you're always tired like me, you need to see this."

"I didn’t expect much… but this caught me off guard."

"This tiny change? Totally flipped my routine."

(Part 2) Personal Experience – Real, Relatable, Not Exaggerated
Goal: Share a real transformation. Keep it human and believable.
Avoid: Terms like “guaranteed”, “100% cured”, “permanent solution”.

✅ Sample Stories:

"At first, I was skeptical… but I gave it a try, and honestly, it feels different now."

"I used to struggle with [problem], but after using this for a while, I noticed a real shift."

"Didn’t think it’d work for me, but it made my day way smoother."

"This isn’t magic or anything – but it made life just a little easier."

"Small change, big difference. I keep reaching for it every day now."

(Part 3) Create Scarcity – Gently, Honestly
Goal: Add urgency in a natural way.
Avoid: Hard pressure or fake scarcity (like “only 1 left!” unless it’s true).

✅ Sample Scarcity Lines:

"I saw it selling fast, so I grabbed one before it was gone."

"The last drop sold out in no time – I didn’t want to miss this round."

"A friend told me it keeps going out of stock – so I didn’t wait."

"Better to get it now than regret later!"

"It’s popular for a reason… just don’t wait too long."

(Part 4) Clear Call to Action (CTA) – Simple, Direct
Goal: Make it clear what they should do next.
Avoid: Pushy phrases like “Buy now or miss out forever!”

✅ Sample CTAs:

"Tap the link to check it out – you’ll see what I mean."

"Go see if it’s still in stock – I hope it is!"

"Hit the button and take a quick look – you might love it."

"Don’t overthink – just go peek at it real quick!"

"Click through and see if it fits your vibe."
